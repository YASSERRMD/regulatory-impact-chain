# Regulatory Impact Chain Visualizer

This repository contains a research implementation generated using Chat.z.ai Agent Mode powered by GLM-5.

## Research Context

This project benchmarks GLM-5’s ability to model multi-layer dependency propagation systems within a relational database environment.

The evaluation focuses on:

- Directed dependency graph modeling
- Weighted impact propagation
- Event-based recalculation
- State consistency across updates

## Project Overview

Regulatory Impact Chain Visualizer models how regulation changes propagate across departments, budgets, services, and KPIs.

Core capabilities:

- Regulation management
- Dependency graph modeling
- Weighted impact propagation engine
- Timeline delta comparison
- Risk severity scoring
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Audit logging

## Technology Stack

- Next.js 16
- Node.js API Routes
- Prisma with SQLite
- In-memory caching
- Socket.io
- Docker

## Research Objective

This project evaluates GLM-5’s ability to:

- Design dependency propagation systems
- Implement multi-layer recalculation logic
- Maintain data isolation boundaries
- Integrate analytical computation into full-stack applications
